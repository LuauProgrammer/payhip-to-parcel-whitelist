# payhip-to-parcel-whitelist
A web server that automates USD payments with Parcel by using Payhip.

## Getting Started

### Preparing Payhip

First things first, lets head on over to Payhip > Settings > Advanced Settings > Checkout Questions and click 
"Display your own questions for customers to answer during checkout". Then, create a question asking the user what their ROBLOX username is. If you already have several questions up, you will need to figure out what index the question is at. Questions indexes start at 0. So your first question would be 0, second would be 1, and so on. If the index is not 0, save the index somewhere safe as we'll need it later.

This is incredibly important. Your product name on Payhip MUST be the same as the product name on Parcel. If it isn't, this will not work.

### Preparing Parcel

So in order for us to whitelist our user, we'll need to get our hub secret key. To do this run this with parcel:
```
/settings
```
Then select hub settings and your hub secret key will be spoilered. Save this somewhere and dont give it to anybody.

### Cloning & Setting Up The Server

Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/LuauProgrammer/payhip-to-parcel-whitelist.git
```
```
cd payhip-to-parcel-whitelist
```
Then, download required dependencies:
```
yarn add
```

### Configuring The Environment

Here come's the harder part, setting up your env:
```
LOG_AND_DM_USER = <boolean> (logs the purchase to your purchase channel and dms the user their product, default is false)
WEBHOOK_ROUTE = "/webhook" (where are we listening for incoming webhooks, default is root)
QUESTION_INDEX=<integer> (the question number that is asked at checkout to search for the customers roblox username, default is 0)
PARCEL_SECRET_KEY=<string> (bare minimum required for this to work, you can get this by running /settings with parcel and selecting hub settings)
PAYHIP_API_KEY=<string> (located in the developers tab of your payhip account settings, the api key is used to match request signatures up to the api keys hash, not required but it prevents a bad actor from forging requests to your server)
PORT=<integer> (self explanatory)
```
We went over how to get whats needed above, paste it in here. After that we can start the server:
```
yarn run build
```
```
yarn run start
```

### Adding our server to the list of webhooks to ping

In your Payhip developer tab there is a ping endpoints box. Put your domain and the route (example: https://domain.com/route/) in there and save.

## How does it work?

This works by using Payhips webhooks that are sent everytime a user purchases something. When the webhook is received on the server, we check the question index for the provided username. Then we query Parcel for the product ID from the provided product name on Payhip. After that if all the other checks and whatnot pass, we will whitelist the user using Parcel's API.

If you're wondering why we always return status code 200, it's because Payhip will keep retrying the webhook if it doesn't return code 200.

## Need help?

I'm aware these docs suck like a lot. Feel free to DM me on Discord for assistance debugging, setting up, etc.
